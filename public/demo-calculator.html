Each year, the income threshold for eligibility is adjusted so that each year, 70% qualify.

That increase could’ve been due in part to the very public push to get filers and nonfilers alike on record and eligible for Economic Impact Payments as part of COVID-19 pandemic relief.

The FTC now prohibits the company from advertising services as free unless they are, in fact, free for everyone or it discloses the percentage who will qualify before the user begins.
